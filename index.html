  <p>Hello all! Welcome to Sugar Daddy's Sugar House. We make only the finest maple syrups that the good maple trees of Tokyo have to offer. Sugar Daddy's employs the age old technique of providing so much love and romantic care to our maple trees that they simply just start crying in happyness. Of course, this is an unconventional method and is not sanctioned by the TMSC (Tokyo Maple Syrup Commission) but produces a product that is far superior in quality and flavor to the standard combini SHIT. Sugar Daddy's currently produces three varieties of our grade AAA maple syrup.</p>

    <td>So this is your standard grade AAA maple syrup for all y'all soccer moms and babies out there. These maple tree tears were selected with sunshine and a mile high stack of limp-dick pancakes in mind. Family friendly and more delicious than grandma's hamhocks.</td>

    <td>Stank. Our third and final variety of grade AAA Tokyo Maple Syrup is produced and bottled with only one thing in mind. Dirt nasty, hot and sweaty, back of the stationwagon, coachella style love makin'. We have started marketing this solely to the sexiest models on instagram as an alcohol alternative and are looking forward to a great quarter 3 when we beleive our product will overtake FourLoko as the first and only product on the market that can get that girl or guy you have been crushin' on out of their pants faster than George RR Martin can kill off the next game of Thrones main character. Enjoy. </td>
